##### Step 1: Pre-train the __NeighborGraph__ model  
##### Step 2: Upgrade the __FairMOT__ tracker (FairMOT: On the Fairness of Detection and Re-Identification in Multiple Object Tracking) with the files in "tracker_parts" as follows:  
        gcn => FairMOT/src/lib/models/  
        multitracker.py => FairMOT/src/lib/tracker/  
        track.py => FairMOT/src/  
        track_half.py => FairMOT/src/
